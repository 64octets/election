I'm announcing my candidacy for PTL of the Security project during the
Newton release cycle.

As one of the founders of the Security project I believe I have a strong
base from which to continue developing and enhancing security within
OpenStack.

The security project has taken great strides during this release cycle.
In future we will deliver on stronger security controls, foster more
security innovations and deliver a comprehensive threat analysis
process.
