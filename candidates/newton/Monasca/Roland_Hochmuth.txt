I would like to propose my candidacy for the Monasca PTL. 

I have been acting as the PTL on Monasca for the Mitaka release, and I would
like to continue.

My goals and objectives for the project in the Newton release are as follows:

* Add new incremental features that are important for operational monitoring
use cases such as to help with visualization or integrate with other projects. 
Recently, there has been a lot of great work in this area, but it will
probably continue.

* Add significant new functionality such as the logging API as well as work
with other organizations on adding advanced analytics for alarm clustering
and anomaly detection.

* Improve performance and scalability. Although Monasca is extremely performant
new bottlenecks always seem to occur and there are always interesting ways to
address them.

* Integrate with other OpenStack projects better, such as Heat, Congress, 
Vitrage, and the recently added Broadview project for network monitoring.

* Evangelize Monasca and grow the developer and operator base.

* Facilitate the development eco-system.

* Write more code.
