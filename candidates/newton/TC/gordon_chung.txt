hi folks,

i'd like to announce my candidacy for the OpenStack Technical Committee.

as a quick introduction, i've been a contributor in OpenStack for the past few
years, focused primarily on various Telemetry and Oslo related projects. i was
recently the Project Team Liaison for the Telemetry project, and currently,
i'm an engineer at Huawei Technologies Canada where i work with a team of
developers that contribute to the OpenStack community.

my views on what the next steps for OpenStack are are not unique. i share the
idea: OpenStack needs to refine its mission. this is not to dissuade
developers from continuing to build upon and extend the existing projects but i
think OpenStack should concern itself with the core story first before worrying
about extended use cases.

Also, i believe that the existing projects in OpenStack are too siloed. coming
from a project that interacts with all other services, it's quite apparent
that projects are focused solely on their own offerings and ignoring how it
works globally. tighter collaboration between projects i believe will help make
integration easier and more efficient. similar to how services within a project
just work together, projects should just work together.

in many ways i see the Technical Committee as the Cross Project Liaisons some
of us are searching for. rather than act as Guardians of "what is OpenStack", i
think the TC should take a more active role in the projects and work together
with the PTLs to ensure that the "Cloud" story makes sense. PTLs and TC members
should work side by side to identify gaps in the story rather than the current
interaction agreement of "you're in. we'll talk if stuff hits the fan".

understandly the Cloud story is different to many people so i'll employ the
strategy i've used previously: listen to others, share the decision, share the
blame, and claim the success.

thanks for you time.
