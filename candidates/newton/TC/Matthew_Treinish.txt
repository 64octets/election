Hi Everyone,

I'd like to submit my candidacy for the OpenStack Technical Committee.

I've been involved with OpenStack since the Folsom cycle. In that time I've
worked on a lot of varied parts of OpenStack. During this time I have started
and led several key initiatives and projects (mostly centered around QA and the
gate) in OpenStack including:

 * Starting the elastic-recheck project with Joe Gordon
 * Enabling parallel tempest execution. This made our gate test environment more
   closely resemble a real environment by having multiple API requests happen at
   once. It's shook loose a ton of race conditions in projects
 * Creating tempest-lib and the tempest plugin interface
 * Creating subunit2sql and starting the openstack-health dashboard
 * Helping debug gate issues and consistently helping with firefighting blocking
   gate issues

I also served as the QA PTL for the past 4 cycles from Juno through Mitaka. It
was in this role that I've interacted with most of the projects/teams in
OpenStack and gained an appreciation for where OpenStack works at it's best and
at it's worst.

As a community I see our greatest weaknesses (and strengths) come from having
a large and diverse platform and ecosystem. While I do believe that for
OpenStack to succeed we do need a large ecosystem of projects, which the big
tent was introduced to address, I feel in the process we have lost some
concentration as a community on having a strong base and clear messaging about
OpenStack. With everyone distracted by the big tent it often leaves things in
the small tent, which holds up the entire ecosystem, not getting the attention
it should.

The other aspect that comes with this is the messaging around OpenStack. I've
had many conversations with people outside the community about how they choose
not to use or contribute to OpenStack because it's not clear what it is, where
to begin, or how to use it. I feel this is largely because we grew quite quickly
after converting to the big tent and we need to do a better job of helping users
bridge the gap here. Tags were a start, but I still think there is a way to
go before we can say we've solved this problem.

As a member of the TC I'd want to bring more focus to these problems. I'd like
to see the TC take a more active role and take a more hands on approach in the
technical oversight of projects. I'd also want to work on making our messaging
about what OpenStack is much clearer.

It would be my honor and privilege to serve the community if I'm lucky enough
to be a elected to the TC.

Thanks,

Matthew Treinish
