Hi - I am announcing my candidacy for the OpenStack Technical Committee for
the upcoming term.

Currently, I am a Data Center Software Planner at Intel. I have been an
active member in the community since 2013, working with Community teams
to understand market needs and bring that information to the Community
(in the form of specs, blueprints, prototypes and user stories) and
developing materials to speed planning for, and adoption of OpenStack
(multi-release roadmaps, Reference Architectures, Customer Testimonials,
Evaluation and Deployment guides, etc).

As a TC member, I will work to support our success by utilizing my areas
of expertise. Specifically, you can expect me to:

1) Collaborate to more tightly integrate requirements from our Markets
into the Specification, Design and Development processes across projects.

2) Establish a mechanism for tracking the implementation of specifications
and communicating progress and plans to our Markets and ecosystem.

3) Foster discussion on the future direction for our Community and our
software. Whatâ€™s the vision of the Data Center of the Future? What is
needed to realize that? How do we make sure that OpenStack is the
preferred Cloud Platform in this future environment?

4) Work to ensure we have a thriving community that welcomes all comers
and supports them to become contributing members and leaders.

We have a lot of opportunity for growth and success. I would like to
join the TC to help our Community realize this potential.

Thank you for your consideration

Carol Barrett
