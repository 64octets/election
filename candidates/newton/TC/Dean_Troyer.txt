I am Dean Troyer and would like to nominate myself as a candidate for re-election
to the Technical Committee.

I have a bit of history with OpenStack: I was early contributor to DevStack, I
started Grenade to perform basic upgrade testing, and I started the OpenStackClient
project. I currently work for Intel from the heart of flyover country, Kansas City MO.

As we gained experience with the Big Text transition I believe it has become
increasingly clear that we need to refine our mission and focus, and get a little
more specific about what should be part of OpenStack and what should be separate.
It may be more appropriate to look at OpenStack not as a single large tent, but as
a group of connected medium-sized tents.

The fundamental idea of the Big Tent is still sound, however, I believe our
experience shows that we need to refine the application. The core of this has not
changed in my view, we still must define these tents by the technical relationships
between projects. As much as some try to deny it, not all projects are created equal.
For example, Nova will always need Glance, unless Nova grown its own image service.

I believe we need to get our current house (tent!) in order and simplify what we
have rather than focus on growing the number of projects and features. For the TC,
one form this takes is in encouraging projects to periodically focus on lowering
technical debt. Often called a 'stability release' this is unpopular with those
who measure success by how many features have been added. I think it is up to the
TC to encourage measuring success by other things that are harder to count, like
the improvement of operators and users lives by making OpenStack feel like a more
cohesive collection of projects.

I would be honored to continue serving the community on the Technical Committee.
