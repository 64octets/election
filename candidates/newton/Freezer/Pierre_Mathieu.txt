Hi everyone,

I'm happy to announce my candidacy to be the Freezer PTL for the Newton release
cycle.

The Freezer developper team grew a lot during the Mitaka timeframe and I think
we can be proud of the work we accomplished now that we are part of the Big
Tent.

I want for Newton to be the cycle where we mature and stabilize Freezer in
order to drive acceptance and grow our community.

In order to achieve that, I think we should focus on:

* Refactoring the freezer-agent, in order to implement multiple plugin
  layers as agreed during the midcycle meetup.

* Integration tests. We need to increase the work done on testing. This will
  help to stabilize Freezer.

* Documentation. We should target for a split, refactoring and global
  improvement of our docs, which is a required step to increase the size of our
  community.

* Integration of Oslo components. We are still missing oslo.policy as well as
  oslo.logging in some components.

* Block-based incremental engine. This is how we will improve the backup of
  rapidly changing files.


I would be honored to have your support.

Thanks,
Pierre (slashme)
