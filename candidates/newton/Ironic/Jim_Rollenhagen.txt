Hi all,

I've had the pleasure of serving the ironic community as PTL for the
Mitaka cycle, and I'd like to do it again for the Newton cycle, if
you'll have me. We've done some amazing things over the past 6 months
and I think we can do even more over the next 6 months.

Things I'd like to do:

* Bring on more core reviewers. I've noticed some people interacting
  more with the community, as well as reviewing more, and I'd like
  for us to mentor them to get them to a place where they will be an
  effective core.

* Finish the neutron integration. I failed during this cycle to
  sufficiently herd cats to help get this done, but we're almost there
  and it should be easy to finish this early in Newton. We should also
  start working on the even bigger plan of fully decoupling the
  user-facing neutron networking from physical infrastructure.

* Begin working on boot-from-volume. This is an often requested feature
  that will take a long time to get right. We should start working on
  it now to make sure we can deliver it in Newton or Ocata.

* Seriously, make our gate better. We keep talking about this, and
  while we continue to make small improvements, I'd like our gate
  to be rock-solid with substantial coverage (including upgrades!) by
  the end of Newton.

* Get the work done in Nova to move to a multiple compute service
  model. This is the cause of a number of pain points. We need to get
  the ironic side to enable this done ASAP, and I hope to also have
  the nova code done by Newton, though I honestly wouldn't be surprised
  if it lagged to Ocata.

Whether or not you elect me as PTL, I look forward to contributing to
all of these items and more during the Newton cycle. :)

Thanks for reading,
