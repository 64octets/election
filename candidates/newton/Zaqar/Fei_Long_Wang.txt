Hi all,

I've had the pleasure of serving the Zaqar community as PTL for the
Mitaka cycle, and I'd like to continue for Newton cycle, if
you'll have me.

For Newton release, things I'd like to do:

1. Real-world deployment
   Puppet Zaqar is ready. Ansible Zaqar role is on the way. So we need to get
the ansible work done ASAP,  and then interlock and provide more support for
potential cloud providers who have shown interest for Zaqar.

2. Notification service
   We got notification service alive since Liberty and fixed several bugs in
Mitaka. But we do still have things to do to make it fully functioning.
Such as subscription confirm and more drivers, etc.

2. Docs
   The config reference doc has been done in Mitaka which is an fantastic
milestone. And in Newton, I would like to complete API reference document
and admin guide for Zaqar.

4. Collaboration with other OpenStack projects
   We did a great job in Mitaka for the integration with Aodh, Mistral and
Tripleo. And I believe there are some other projects could be benefited by
Zaqar. For example, the notification middleware of Swift, Zaqar's websocket
transport for Searchlight/Horizon etc.

5. Encourage diversity in our Community
   We got some new members joined the team in Mitaka. And one of them has been
nominated as core reviewer who grew very fast. It's really awesome. In
Newton, I would like to encourage more people/organizations to join Zaqar
community.

It's a fantastic experience working with this amazing team and I know without
the dedication and hard work of everyone who has contributed to Zaqar we can't
make those success stories of Mitaka happen. I would be pleased to serve
as PTL for another cycle and I'd appreciate your vote.

Thanks for your consideration!
