I would like to announce my candidacy for OpenStackClient PTL for the Newton
release cycle.

We have continued to grow the core team for OpenStackClient and have picked
up the pace from even more new contributors.

OSC reached a couple of major milestones during the Mitaka timeframe:
* introduction of the OpenStack SDK as a dependency
* a significant number of NetworkAPI commands implemented (many more to go
  though) using the SDK
* expansion of the unit test and functional test coverage

The upcoming releases will include additional Network commands as well as
some significant Volume v2 additions for features beyond our initial
v1-equivalent support.  I also think we need to greatly expand our
documentation to actually explain what the commands accomplish on the
server, with examples, and not just map to the server API documentation.

I would be honored to have your support.
