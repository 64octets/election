I would like to announce my candidacy for Barbican PTL for the Newton cycle.

I've been a part of the Barbican team since the beginning of the project, and
I've had the opportunity to serve as PTL for the last three cycles.  I'm proud
of the work we've done, and I would be honored to continue to be your PTL.

For the Newton cycle I would like to see our team continue to mature the
Barbican project.  I'd especially like to focus on improving our documentation
for both Barbican and Castellan so that operators and developers can better
understand how these projects can help improve the security of their OpenStack
clouds.
