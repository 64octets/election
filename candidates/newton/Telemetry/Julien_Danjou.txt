Hi there,

The Telemetry project had a tremendous run so far, and I'm willing to help it
continue on that trajectory. We have an awesome community, and we had the
chance to be led by great leaders so far, which directed the team and projects
in an open and enthusiast manner.

Our previous PTL helped the community to grow in a fabulous way over the last 2
cycles, and I'm glad to be able to follow his footsteps. As you may know, I've
already been Ceilometer PTL during the Havana and Icehouse cycles, and it'd be
with a great pleasure that I would take up the torch again. I'll continue to
manage the project in a transparent way and do everything I can to grow our
community and make people feel welcome.

Looking forward to Newton, I hope we'll be able to continue improving our
deliverables. Some items I'd like to target are:

- Continue splitting Ceilometer into smaller parts. Aodh has been a success,
  it's time to create another one.

- Continue code refactoring and technical debt addressing. We're probably one
  of the most aggressive and efficient project on that, but that gives us an
  amazing outlook.

- Reduce Ceilometer hard-coupling to OpenStack projects.
  We applied this strategy from scratch to Gnocchi, and to some extent to Aodh,
  with great success. Let's continue that.

Cheers,

jd
