Hi guys,

I'd like to announce my candidacy for newton PTL of Telemetry program.

I've been a Ceilometer core for several cycles, looking Ceilometer growing
from a small project to a umbrella program containing 3 managed projects
and multiple externally managed projects, thanks to the great works of the
community and previous PTLs.

Looking forward to the newton cycle, I'd like to improve the deliverables
with the community, with the following focuses:

 * Refine the Ceilometer's polling mechanism, including decouple polling
   logic from pipeline, etc.

 * Do some performance test and find the potential reference architecture
   debt to tackle with.

Best Regards,
- Lianhao Lu
