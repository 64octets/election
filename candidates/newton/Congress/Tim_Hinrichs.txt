Hi all,

I'm writing to announce my continued candidacy for Congress PTL.

In the Mitaka cycle we've been working hard and making great progress
on a number of things.  The largest change is a new distributed architecture 
built on top of oslo-messaging.  That architecture is key to enabling us 
to meet the high-availability and high throughput demands that we've 
heard from the field.  We also saw the first new mechanism since the 
project's inception for injecting data into Congress, so that external 
systems can push data, instead of Congress pulling it.  In Mitaka, 
we also completed the transition to Python3, and implemented the plugin 
interface for both tempest and devstack.  It's also exciting that over 
the last two cycles, we have seen longer-term commitments to Congress
from the community, with 1 new core reviewer this cycle, and two other
incredibly active contributors.

In Newton, my primary technical goal is to complete the migration to
our new distributed architecture.  I also hope to have Congress 
leverage that new architecture to provide high-availability and 
high-throughput solutions.  I plan to continue discussions with 
other projects to understand how and where Congress can be useful.
Finally, I'm looking forward to stengthening the developer
community around Congress.

Tim
