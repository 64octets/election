Hi All!

I am proposing myself for PTL of the Designate project.

In the last 6 months we have had a smaller amount of changes into 
the project, but this has not nesissarly been a bad thing for us.

We have stabalised some of the changes that have been filtering through
over the last year or so, and have this cycle had a chance to evaluate 
what we have completed, and what needs to change.

I think we now have a solid base to add new features for end users 
(like ALIAS) and operators (MiniDNS simplifiaction + possible replacement
in a sane language, IXFR).

As we progress we will need to get more integrated into the community, 
like we have with Nova, Neutron and Designate integration that has merged
this cycle. We should build on this to add content to the shared Docs, 
API reference site and other projects.

Next cycle we need to focus on 3 items:

1.  Docs. Docs. Docs. 

    We have gotten better at writing docs, and the addition of reno has help our
    release notes a lot, but there is always room for improvement. We need to ensure
    that we also remove old docs at the same time as writing new ones.

2.  Worker Model.

    Migration to the worker model improves a lot of our scaling story. It allows use to 
    remove the extra code that went into MiniDNS and remove RPC from MiniDNS entirely. 
    This in turn makes MiniDNS much more reimplementable in a language that is more 
    suited to parsing and building DNS packets.

3.  Horizon Updates (Read: replacement)

    Our horizon panels are ... dated, use the deprecated API, and lack most of the new 
    features that we have added to designate. Part of our time in newton needs to be
    getting these panels updated, and availible to the community.

I see myself as a good person to lead these 3 priorities, and appriciate your 
support for PTL.

Thanks,

Graham Hayes
