Hi folks,

I'm announcing my candidacy for PTL for Horizon for the Newton release cycle.

My main goals for the cycle are:

- Remove roadblocks from AngularJS development so that the code can
  mature. This means optimistically approving patches in the experimental
  disabled panels, so that it can be rapidly iterated. The Swift rewrite is a
  fantastic example of how focused reviews and dropping the demand for
  absolute perfection allow for a dramatically improved experience via
  AngularJS.

- Work on scale issues, and improve non-performant content. There are a number
  of panels in Horizon that are often unused (especially in the Admin
  dashboard). We need to apply the existing tools available to us such as
  pagination and filtering, as well as investigate other proposals.

- Improve bug management and project organisation. In the past few cycles, the
  bugs and blueprints on launchpad have been quickly growing while triage work
  dwindles. In Mitaka, we've run several bug days as well as holding a Horizon
  Drivers meeting every other week to analyse blueprints as a group. I'd like
  to continue the focus on bringing our tooling back to useable state, so that
  we correctly address current issues and customer needs.

Finally, I believe one of the most important parts of being a PTL is community
engagement, and will continue to build an active and positive developer
community.

Thanks,
Rob
