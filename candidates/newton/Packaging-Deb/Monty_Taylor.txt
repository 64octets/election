I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of the Packaging-deb project.

This might surprise some people, as it's not an area I'm sure many of you
associate me with. So I figure I should enumerate my qualifications:

First and foremost - I am the only ATC in the project currently.

Before that, I believe I qualify as a good candidate by having been one of the
maintainers of the last set of distro packages (Ubuntu at the time) that were
produced by the project.

Before we had devstack, and indeed before we had Gerrit, we used to use a
system for the gate that consisted of a program called Tarmac, the predecessor
to Jenkins which was called Hudson, bzr branches on Launchpad - and a set of
PPAs containing packages. Changes to projects were tested against distro
packaged dependency sets, and the way that one expressed a new dependency
was to land a change to the Build-Depends of the project in question.

It wasn't a great system - but it served us for that period of time. In any
case, the majority of the effort I spent on OpenStack in the Austin-Diablo
period was dealing with the debian packaging related to that.

So as the only human who has landed patches in the current project repository
AND the only one of those to have maintained packages for the project, I think
I bring a singular set of qualifications to the job.

I will try, should I be elected by the electorate, to ensure that we do not
reach the next PTL election with an electorate of one.
