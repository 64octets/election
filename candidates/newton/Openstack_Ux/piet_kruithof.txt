Iâ€™m interested in continuing my role as PTL for the OpenStack UX project.

Over the past six months, the team has been able to support multiple design and research efforts
including the ironic, swift, LBaaS, DBaaS, and the mobile client.  In addition, we were also able
to add UI content guidelines to the OpenStack Documentation Contributor Guide.   Finally, the team
will be redesigning the Horizon Overview panel and running a usability on the OpenStack Client
before the Austin Summit.

Following the summit, the project is planning to create a GUI for both installation and
configuration from bare metal to the user launching their first VM and propose design concepts to
improve operator experience for managing quotas.  In addition, the project is also planning to
replace the Invision mock review tool with an open source solution.  Finally, we are also hoping to
create a cross project specification for the OpenStack personas.

Of course, none of this would be possible without the significant efforts of the OpenStack UX team.
