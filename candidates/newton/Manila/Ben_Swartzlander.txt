I am running again for the position of Manila PTL.

Since the self nomiation period is in the middle of bugfixing I'm not going
to write up a long campaign speech.

Mitaka has seen a lot of successes:
* Continued growth of the community
* More new drivers (first party and 3rd party)
* Major new feature merged (share replication)
* Infrastruture improvements needed for migration

There have been some challenges too:
* Gate is still not reliable
* Overwhelming number of bugs
* Distro-related problems with new first party drivers

If elected PTL for Newton I plan to prioritize finishing the things we've
started over starting new things. We have overwhelming evidence that big
things take more than 6 months to get completely right and the experimental
API approach we started in Liberty is paying off.

I want to wrap up migration and replication. I want to solve the issues
related to our first party drivers. I want to drive bugs down to a
manageable level. And I want to start promoting experimental things to
supported APIs.
