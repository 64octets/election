I would like to announce my candidacy for Astara PTL for the Newton release
cycle.

Over the past several years, I've been heavily involved as an active
contributor and core reviewer in the Astara orchestrator service and Astara
router appliance.  My contributions and lengthy experience working with and
deploying Astara at DreamHost have equipped me for the role of PTL.  A few goals
I'd like to aim for in the Newton release include:

Increased Community Growth
==========================
New contributors are starting to express interest in the Astara project - I'd
like to continue to foster this interest in the project and grow the size of our
community.

Finalize VPNaaS
===============
We made leaps and bounds with VPNaaS development in Mitaka - my goal for Newton
is for this functionality to be production-ready.

Add Support for Additional Drivers
==================================
I'd like to expand on our work in Mitaka and Liberty by incorporating drivers
for additional network functions (including growing links with other
network-related projects within the OpenStack community).

Support Python 3
================
It's time to embrace Python 3 as the default language of choice for Astara.  I'd
like for Astara in Newton to be fully supported in Python 3.

I would be honored to have your support.
