Hello everyone,

I would like to announce my candidacy to continue to serve as RefStack PTL for
the Newton release.

Over the last Mitaka development cycle, we have made a lot of progress in
delivering numerous new features to improve the stability and usability of
RefStack website and RefStack client.  The top features are:

1) Associated test data to users instead of user keys.
2) Associated specific DefCore Guideline and OpenStack Target Program to a test
   result set.
3) Provided option to allow uploading data in subunit data format.
4) Enabled running in-tree tests that implemented Tempest Plugin Interface.

In the past couple of months, we also have started working on providing
additional features to allow vendor and product registration at RefStack. These
are very important features because they are the foundation for the future
features such as: enabling centralized testing, perform statistical analysis of
the collected result data, etc.  Hence we have spent a lot of time to document
the requirements, use cases, data model and data privacy concern before coding.
However, there are still a lot of work that needs to be continued to keep moving
the progress forward.

I hope to have the opportunity to continue leading the RefStack team as PTL and
make Newton another successful cycle for RefStack.
