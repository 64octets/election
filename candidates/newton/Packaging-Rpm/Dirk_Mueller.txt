Hi everyone,

I'd like to announce my candidacy for the RPM Packaging for OpenStack PTL. I
am putting up the candidacy because I would feel honored to continue doing the
PTL role, but I'm also fine with passing on the torch. At the end of the
day what matters is that the project becomes successful and relevant and
I'm happy to contribute my share to that.

During the Mitaka cycle I've been working closely with our small but motivated
contributor group to reach a critical mass of package spec files to self-sustain
the project. While we haven't reached the full goal the trend is up[1] and I still
very much care about the idea and implementation. We're at least in a
state where the spec file templates are already in actual production use
by one of the vendors (SUSE), and both Red Hat and Mirantis are considering it.

We've reached a lot by diligently working through the various RPM packaging
vendors packaging requirements and abstracting them in a way that allows
them to feel "native" to the platform while still sharing the bulk of the
work on packaging openstack and I'd be happy to work on that further with
the help from the other contributors.

Obviously all that I did so far I would like to continue and make sure that
we build something that everyone can embrace.

For Newton I would like to focus on:

* Extend package spec template set to cover the bulk of packages that define
  an OpenStack distribution and are maintained in the OpenStack git/gerrit

* Foster collaboration with downstream packaging vendors (Mirantis/RDO/SUSE) to
  switch to the common packaging by working through barriers that prevent
  adoption and contributions.

* Work with downstream packaging vendors to contribute extra CI for their platform,
  as currently only SUSE invested the effort in adding a check CI step.


Thanks,
Dirk
