Hi everyone,

I'm announcing my candidacy for PTL of the CloudKitty team during the Newton
cycle.

Some of the features and improvements of the project I envisioned are not yet
ready and contributed and there is more to come. But due to lack of
contributor's time we'll need more time to make them a reality.
That's why I'd like to apply for a second cycle to help the project get these
features and keep the project going forward.
My main focus during this cycle will be to improve project communication and
community development.

As we are about to get released as part of Mitaka, I hope it will help the
CloudKitty project get a better focus from other people and increase
contributions.

During the Newton cycle I'd like to keep the project focused on these specific
points:

- Improve code QA and global test coverage, Mikata was a good step forward but
  we can go further.

- Improve internal data modeling and global user experience with new APIs.

- Improve performances and scaling.

Cheers
