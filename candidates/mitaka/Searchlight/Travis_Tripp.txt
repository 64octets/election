Hello friends,

We are now going into our first official PTL election for Searchlight and I
would be honored if you’ll allow me to continue serving in the PTL role.

Searchlight became a new project in Liberty after being split out from its
initial experimental days in Glance. Since then we’ve been we’ve been moving
at a relatively fast pace towards fulfilling our mission: To provide advanced
and scalable indexing and search across multi-tenant cloud resources.

It would be a huge understatement to say that accomplishing this mission is
important to me. I believe that search is critical to enabling a better
experience for OpenStack users and operators alike.

In Liberty, we have made tremendous progress thanks to a small, but
passionate team who believes in the vision of Searchlight. At the Mitaka
summit we’ll be able to demonstrate a Horizon panel plugin able to search
across Glance, Nova, and Designate.

I believe that the PTL role is a commitment to the community to act as a
steward for the project. As PTL for an early stage project like searchlight,
I believe that some of these responsibilities are to:

* Evangelize the project across the OpenStack ecosystem
* Provide technical guidance and contribution
* Facilitate collaboration across the community
* Enable all developers to contribute effectively
* Grow a community of potential future project PTLs
* And perhaps most importantly, enable the project to release

I believe software must be developed with a clear demonstration of its
value. With Searchlight, I do believe that a UI is one of the most effective
ways to bring the value of Searchlight to OpenStack users. This is why
from day 1, I have been actively evangelizing Searchlight with Horizon. Once
users are able to actually take advantage of Searchlight, I believe
Searchlight will become a must have component of any OpenStack deployment.

From a feature standpoint, I believe all of the following are great
candidate goals for us to pursue in Mitaka and I look forward to working
with the community as establish priorities.

* (Obviously) Extend search indexing to as many projects as possible
** With a priority on the original integrated release projects
* Provide reference deployment architectures and deployment tooling as needed
* Establish performance testing
* Work towards cross-region search support
* Enable pre-defined quick queries for the most common searches
* Release the horizon search panel either in Horizon master or on its own
* Enable horizon top nav search to become a reality [0]

Thank you for your consideration in allowing me to continue serving as PTL
for the Mitaka cycle.

Thank you,
Travis
