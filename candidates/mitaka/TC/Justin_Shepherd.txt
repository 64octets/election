Hello! I would like to announce my candidacy for the TC election.

A bit about me and my involvement with OpenStack: I have been involved with
OpenStack since the Bexar days. I have contributed over that time to most of
the pre-big-tent 'integrated release' projects. Through this time, I have
strived to represent issues and features for the Operator Persona. It is
amazing to see just how far OpenStack has come in this short time. When i first
started, it took numerous animal sacrifices to get a working cloud deployed.
Now there are numerous distributions and projects that exist to make installing
a cloud easy-ish, and tons of healty innovation happening on top of the IaaS
platform components.

I work for Rackspace in the Private Cloud business unit, deploying and managing
OpenStack clouds for all sizes of customers all over the world. Over the course
of the last 5 years, I have trodden the path of bespoke hand-rolled clouds all
the way to standardized/repeatable clouds. This process has given me a
foundational understanding of the core IaaS projects within the Big-Tent. I
have also helped start up the chef-openstack and openstack-ansible projects,
which both center around establishing a standard deployment process for
OpenStack. I have also been involved in the DefCore project for quite some
time, and have been an advocate for Rackspace's public cloud to move back to
upstream code and a removal of non-community bits.

It would be an honor to serve on the TC. If elected I will focus on bringing an
Operators point of view to the conversation, as well as a strong focus on
manageability, stability and scalability.

Thank you,
