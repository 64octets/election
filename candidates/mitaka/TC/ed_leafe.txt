Greetings Stackers! I'm announcing my candidacy for the Technical Committee
Elections.

Those of you who have been involved in OpenStack most likely know me, as I was
part of the original team from Rackspace that created OpenStack in 2010. For
the past year or so I have been employed at IBM to work on 100% upstream
OpenStack development. Part of that time has been spent getting a good overview
of both the project and the community behind it. I've also placed some of my
focus on the groups of people working *with* OpenStack, and not just those
developing it. And to that end I've been working with the current TC as much as
possible, especially in the areas of API standardization and consistency. I'm
always lurking on the regular TC meetings (and sometimes throwing in my two
cents), and reviewing as much of the material as I can. I believe that I can
have a much greater impact as part of the TC instead of just being that
occasional voice from the back of the room.

There are some good reasons not to vote for me: the other TC candidates. I wish
I could run on a "throw out the bums" platform, but that's simply not possible.
I know all the current members, and they have all done an excellent job this
past year, and would all represent the community well if re-elected. I can only
promise that if elected, I will work hard to have at least as much positive
impact on the community as the TC member I might replace. That will be a
difficult task indeed, but I believe that I have the long-term experience to
help guide OpenStack as it continues to grow and thrive in the future.
