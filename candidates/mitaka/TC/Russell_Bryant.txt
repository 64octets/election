Hello!  I would like to submit my candidacy for the TC election.

I work for Red Hat where I am focused upstream on OpenStack and related
technologies.  I've been involved in open source development for over 10
years.  I've been involved in OpenStack development since the Fall of
2011. I've been a TC member since the Fall of 2012.  Earlier on in
my time in OpenStack I worked on Nova, Oslo, and the Vulnerability
Management team.  I also served as the PTL of Nova for the Havana and
Icehouse releases.  Lastly, I've been an elected individual
representative on the OpenStack Foundation board of directors since
January of 2015.

Most recently I have been working on OpenStack networking.  I've been
looking into a lot of open source networking developments that could
help improve our networking story for bare metal, VMs, and containers.
This has included contributing to Neutron as well as OVN in the Open
vSwitch project.

I believe I'm well positioned to help continue to provide guidance to
cross project issues as a TC member.  I've built up strong cross project
perspective by contributing to different parts of OpenStack and talking
to many people from different organizations consuming and contributing
to OpenStack.

It would be an honor to continue my role on the TC for another year.

Thank you,
