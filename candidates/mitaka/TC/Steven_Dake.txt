Hello Peers,

I would be pleased to serve on the Technical Committee with your vote.  I have
a very relevant background to serving you in the Technical Committee in that
I have done the following during OpenStack development:

1. Led the development, incubation, and integration of Heat for the first
   project to enter what would be a precursor to the Big Tent.
2. Wrote most of the initial commits and contributed heavily to the first
   Big Tent project Magnum.
3. Solving the most complex problem OpenStack faces, Deploying the Big Tent,
   by serving as PTL of Kolla which I have led from first commit through the
   Big Tent process.
4. Top 10 contributor by Person-day effort for Liberty.  Top 1% by Person-day
   effort  for Kilo.  Top 1% by Person-day effort for OpenStack project
   overall.

My experience with Heat, Magnum, and Kolla directly relate to the Technical
Committee's charter which is to serve as technical oversight for the OpenStack
project.  I am highly interested in growth management of my peers and the
systems and people I involve myself with.  I believe it is one of the core
responsibilities of the Technical Committee to provide effective growth
management for the OpenStack ecosystem, in partnership with the OpenStack
Board.

I can confirm that the original incubation track that Heat executed was highly
painful and very challenging.  It was not very inclusive, not documented, and
highly subjective.

The new Big Tent process is far improved.  It is almost completely objective
and measurable which in my opinion leads to high growth in individuals and
systems during their evaluation.

Most of the work the Technical Committee has done over the last year has been
to make OpenStack more obecjtive and measurable by anyone.  I personally feel
this change is fantastic and has unstuck the Technical Committeee.  This work
facilitates the growth of OpenStack in general and new projects in particular.

I want to bring my experience creating new things for OpenStack to bear to
create New Things for the Technical Committee to further acclerate growth.
I would happily accept your vote for the Technical Committee election.

Regards,
-steve
