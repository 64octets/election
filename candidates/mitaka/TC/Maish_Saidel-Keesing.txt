Hello to you all.

I would like to propose myself as a candidate for the Technical Committee for
the upcoming term. The reasons for running in the last election [1]
are still relevant for this election of the TC.

Since the last election my involvement in OpenStack has increased with a
spotlight on the Operators aspect of the community:

    - Focusing on the ops-tags-team[2] helping to create tags with the intent of
      creating information relevant to Operators.
    - Helping to vet and review submissions to the OpenStack Planet[3] and
      contributing as a core in openstack-planet-core.
    - Participating in the Item Writing Committee of the first Foundation
      initiative for the inaugural OpenStack Certification Exam Program.

As an OpenStack community we have made some huge steps in the right direction,
and are bringing more and more of the Operator and User community into our
midst. Operators and Users should also be represented in the
Technical Committee.

It is my hope that the electorate accept that there is a huge benefit,
and also a clear need, to have representation from all aspects of OpenStack, not
only from the developer community. When this happens - the disconnect (and
sometimes tension) that we have between these different parts will cease to be
an issue and we as a community will continue to thrive and grow.
In order to finally bridge this gap, it is time to open the ranks, bring an
Operator into the TC and to become truly inclusive.

I humbly ask for your selection so that I may represent Operators in the
Technical Committee for the next term.

Thank you for your consideration.
