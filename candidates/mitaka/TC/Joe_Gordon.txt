Hi Everyone,

I'd like to announce my candidacy for OpenStack Technical Committee. I've been involved with OpenStack since 2011 and
am a top 0.5% contributor to Openstack. This is also regardless of which meaningless metric you decide to highlight
as import. No matter which metric you put weight behind I've likely been a top contributor looking at it through
that lens. For example:

 * Commits: http://stackalytics.com/?release=all&user_id=jogo&metric=commits
 * Reviews: http://stackalytics.com/?release=all&user_id=jogo&metric=marks
 * Emails: http://stackalytics.com/?release=all&user_id=jogo&metric=emails
 * Patch Sets: http://stackalytics.com/?release=all&user_id=jogo&metric=patches
 * Or the absurdly ridiculous person-day effort (which is completely meaningless from what I can tell):
   http://stackalytics.com/?release=all&user_id=jogo&metric=person-day

I also have been a core team member for nova, QA (grenade), infra (elastic-recheck) and hacking

During my time contributing to OpenStack I have led several several key initiatives in a variety of different roles.
From doing things like starting and serving as the maintainer for the hacking project, starting the elastic-recheck
project with the help of the excellent Matthew Treinish, being one of the few people actually willing to
help debug gate issues, and helping set up multinode devstack jobs so we can finally test  things like live migration
(just to name a few in a very long list). Through this experience I've see a lot of what OpenStack has to offer at
it's best, but also where things don't work so well. It is leveraging this experience that I think provides me with
real technical knowledge and insight into what OpenStack is and how it works that I think is necessary to sit on the
TC. (because let's be honest here, the T is for technical, not talking-head)

As a member of the TC I'd really like to accomplish two things during my tenure, change the OpenStack mission
statement (it currently doesn't mention the single most important persona in OpenStack, the end user); and move the
conversation away from the silly 'what is OpenStack' to 'why use OpenStack' and figure out how we execute on the
resulting vision.

While my activity in the community has decreased slightly in recent months, this is not an indication of a decrease
in my commitment to the OpenStack project or a lack of interest in seeing it succeed. It would be my honor and
privilege to serve the community if I'm lucky enough to be a elected to the TC.

May the odds be ever in your favor,

Joe Gordon
