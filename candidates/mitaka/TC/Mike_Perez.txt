Hi all!

I'm announcing my candidacy for a position on the OpenStack Technical
Committee.

On October 1st I will be employed by the OpenStack Foundation as
a Cross-Project Developer Coordinator to help bring focus and support to
cross-project initiatives within the cross-project specs, Def Core, The Product
Working group, etc.

I feel the items below have enabled others across this project to strive for
quality. If you would all have me as a member of the Technical Committee, you
can help me to enable more quality work in OpenStack.

* I have been working in OpenStack since 2010. I spent a good amount of my time
  working on OpenStack in my free time before being paid full time to work on
  it. It has been an important part of my life, and rewarding to see what we
  have all achieved together.

* I was PTL for the Cinder project in the Kilo and Liberty releases for two
  cross-project reasons:
  * Third party continuous integration (CI).
  * Stop talking about rolling upgrades, and actually make it happen for
    operators.

* I led the effort in bringing third party continuous integration to the
  Cinder project for more than 60 different drivers. [1]
  * I removed 25 different storage drivers from Cinder to bring quality to the
    project to ensure what was in the Kilo release would work for operators.
    I did what I believed was right, regardless of whether it would cost me
    re-election for PTL [2].
  * In my conversations with other projects, this has enabled others to want to
    follow the same effort. Continuing this trend of quality cross-project will
    be my next focus.

* During my first term of PTL for Cinder, the team, and much respect to Thang
  Pham working on an effort to end the rolling upgrade problem, not just for
  Cinder, but for *all* projects.
  * First step was making databases independent from services via Oslo
    versioned objects.
  * In Liberty we have a solution coming that helps with RPC versioned messages
    to allow upgrading services independently.

* I have attempted to help with diversity in our community.
  * Helped lead our community to raise $17,403 for the Ada Initiative [3],
    which was helping address gender-diversity with a focus in open source.
  * For the Vancouver summit, I helped bring in the ally skills workshops from
    the Ada Initiative, so that our community can continue to be a welcoming
    environment [4].

* Within the Cinder team, I have enabled all to provide good documentation for
  important items in our release notes in Kilo [5] and Liberty [6].
  * Other projects have reached out to me after Kilo feeling motivated for this
    same effort. I've explained in the August 2015 Operators midcycle meetup
    that I will make this a cross-project effort in order to provide better
    communication to our operators and users.

* I started an OpenStack Dev List summary in the OpenStack Weekly Newsletter
  (What you need to know from the developer's list), in order to enable others
  to keep up with the dev list on important cross-project information. [7][8]

* I created the Cinder v2 API which has brought consistency in
  request/responses with other OpenStack projects.
  * I documented Cinder v1 and Cinder v2 API's. Later on I created the Cinder
    API reference documentation content. The attempt here was to enable others
    to have somewhere to start, to continue quality documentation with
    continued developments.

Please help me to do more positive work in this project. It would be an honor
to be member of your technical committee.


Thank you,
Mike Perez
