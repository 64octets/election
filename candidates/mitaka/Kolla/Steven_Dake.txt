My Peers,

Liberty for Kolla was fantastically successful!  We held our first in person
mid-cycle and entered the Big Tent governance process.  We successfully
released 3 milestone releases within 3 days of deadline with increasing
functionality.  I believe our Kolla release of rc1 on September 25th will
deliver on the promises I made in my PTL candidacy which was to deliver a
container deployment system that could deploy 100 node OpenStack cluster with
controller, compute, storage and networking roles.  I wouldn’t have been able
to do it alone, or even with the small team we had heading into Liberty.  A
big thank you goes out to our community for your strong commitment to our
success! 

A leader’s job is to take the community on the trip they want to go on.  I’ve
done a good job of balancing the various interests in Kolla to lead us to
where I think people wanted us to be at the end of the cycle.  I think we are
a bit ahead on all measures except functional testing.

For Liberty I wish to directly contribute to or facilitate the
following actions:
* Continue to encourage diversity in our Community.
* Obtain real-world production deployments using Kolla.
* Grow out community of developers, reviewers, and operators.
* Execute functional testing of Kolla deployment by using a baby-steps
  strategy, first executing AIO, then two nodes, growing to ~5 node
  multi-node deployments.
* Containerize and deliver all Big Tent server projects with our Ansible
  deployment tooling.
* Radically improve our documentation to match the standards set by mature
  OpenStack Big Tent projects.
* Make the image building and functional gating voting(!) by delivering
  mirrors of our upstream software dependencies internally in OpenStack
  Infrastructure.
* Continue to provide excellent project management and improve our processes
  so that we may grow to use the release_managed[2] tag in the N release.

I am pleased to accept your vote and serve as your PTL for the Mitaka
release cycle.  As a Community I am certain we can make Mitaka as successful
as Liberty!

Regards
-steve
