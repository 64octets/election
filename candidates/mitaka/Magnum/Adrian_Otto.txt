I respectfully respect your support to continue as your Magnum PTL.

Here are are my achievements and OpenStack experience and that make
me the best choice for this role:

* Founder of the OpenStack Containers Team
* Established vision and specification for Magnum
* Served as PTL for Magnum since inception in November 2014
* Successful addition of Magnum to the official OpenStack projects
* Planned/led two successful Magnum Midcycle meetups in 2015
* 4 terms of experience as elected PTL for Solum
* Involved with OpenStack since Austin Design Summit in 2010

What background and skills help me to do this role well:

* 20 years of experience in technical leadership positions
* Considerable experience leading milti-organization collaborations
* Diplomacy skills for inclusion of numerous viewpoints
* Ability to drive consensus and shared vision
* Considerable experience in public speaking
* Experience running design summit sessions
* Deep belief in Open Source/Development/Design/Community
* I love OpenStack and I love containers

What to expect in the Liberty release cycle:

We will continue to focus on making the best Containers-as-a-Service
solution for cloud operators. This requires a valuable vertical
integration of container management tools with OpenStack. Magnum is
quickly maturing. Here are key focus areas that I believe are important
for us to work on during our next release:

* Functional testing, and unit test code coverage
* Overlay networking
* Storage features, including a shared storage solution

I look forward to your vote, and to helping us succeed together.

Thanks,

Adrian Otto
