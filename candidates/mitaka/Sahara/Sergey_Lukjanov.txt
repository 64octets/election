Hi,

I'd like to announce my intention to continue being PTL of the Data
Processing program (Sahara).

I’m working on Sahara (ex. Savanna) project from scratch, from the
initial proof of concept implementation and till now. I have been the
acting/elected PTL since Sahara was an idea. Additionally, I’m
contributing to other OpenStack projects, especially Infrastructure
for the last four releases where I’m core/root teams member now.

My high-level focus as PTL is to coordinate work of subteams, code
review, release management and general architecture/design tracking.

During the Liberty cycle we successfully continued using the specs system.
There were many new contributors during the cycle and we've renewed a lot
the core reviewer team as well. Tons of operability and supportability
improvements were done as well as number of interesting features.

For Mitaka cycle my focus is to keep going in the same direction and
to ensure that everything we're working on is related to the end users
needs. So, in a few words it's about continuing moving forward in
implementing scalable and flexible Data Processing aaS for OpenStack
ecosystem by investing in quality, usability and new features. I'd like
to highlight the following areas that I think very important for Sahara
project in the Mitaka cycle: security of Sahara and Hadoop as well,
scalability (first of all of Sahara itself) and EDP enchancements.

A few words about myself: I’m Principle Software Engineer in Mirantis.
I was working a lot with  Big Data projects and technologies (Hadoop,
HDFS, Cassandra, Twitter Storm, etc.) and enterprise-grade solutions
before (and partially in parallel) working on Sahara in OpenStack ecosystem.
