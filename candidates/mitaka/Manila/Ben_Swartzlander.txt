I am running again for the position of Manila PTL.

I've been proud to serve as PTL for Manila for the first 4 releases and I while
the project has been hugely successful and continues to grow, I still see areas
where more work is needed to make Manila a world-class project.

If elected PTL, my agenda for Mitaka will be:

Alleviate Developer Pain - Too much time is wasted with unstable gate tests and
slow test jobs. My first priority will be to make it easier and faster to get
work done.

Continue Expanding Community - The community has grown a lot and we are
highly diverse, but I think more can be done to welcome new developers and
to make it easier for people to get involved.

Clean Up the Code - Manila has evolved somewhat from it's origins as a fork
of Cinder, and we still carry about some old cruft. This is confusing to users
and developers and makes it hard for new vendors to figure how how to write
a driver. I propose fixing some longstanding inconsistencies and improving
the interface between the Share Manager and the drivers.

Deployer Quality of Life Features - While vendors will always push for features
that show off fancy capabilities of their storage controllers, we have a
responsibility to address the needs of deployers, such as scalability, high
availability, and upgradeability. I would like most of the new feature work in
Mitaka to be oriented around these areas.
