Friends,

After discussing this with a number of you and once again reaffirming support
from my employer it gives me great pleasure to announce my candidacy for
leadership of OpenStack Security Project

The evolution from an informal security group to the recognized security
project for OpenStack has been a tremendous one. With an established mid-cycle
process and massive leaps forward in terms of capability I'm incredibly proud
of what we have managed to achieve in the last 6 months and eagerly look
forward to what the next release cycle will bring.

We have more external contribution to our projects than ever before, more
community engagement and general awareness of security. We have developers
referencing security guidelines and contributing to our book - The OpenStack
Security Guide as well as adopting projects such as Bandit which has been a
major success.

You all know me and many of you have been with me from the start. We've really
built the security project into something to be proud of and it would make me
incredibly proud to be given the opportunity to lead the team once again.

Thanks,

-Rob
