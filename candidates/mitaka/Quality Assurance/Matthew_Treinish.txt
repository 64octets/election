Hi Everyone,

I'd like to throw my hat into the ring for another cycle as the PTL for the QA
program/team/group/project/whatever it's called. (it'll always be program to me)

This past cycle has been a very exciting one for the QA program. We've made a
bunch of progress on numerous work items to improve the growing number of
projects under the QA umbrella. We've been continuing our work to make the QA
projects more modular and to enable other projects to take a more self-service
approach to using them. This has led to things like the introduction of plugin
interfaces to both tempest and grenade. We also have clearly defined the scope
of what should be a plugin vs what should be in tree this past cycle.

Moving into Mitaka I'd like to see us finish up the last pieces of the modular
decoupling work, which is mainly to put into use all the interfaces we've worked
on adding over the few cycles. Then I feel like the other big goal for the
upcoming cycle is to work on the usability side for QA projects.

We've had a lot of work go into this already especially during liberty with some
of the CLI and user workflow improvements we've made to Tempest, documentation
improvements across the board, the work on aggregate test result tracking, and
the new work starting up around visualizing a devstack tempest run. I expect
that during Mitaka we'll continue this work and take it even further into new
directions.

It's been my honor to serve as the QA PTL for the past 3 cycles and I'm looking
forward to helping make Liberty another great cycle. I hope to have the
opportunity to continue leading the QA program as PTL and work towards making
a better OpenStack with the rest of the community.

Thanks,

Matt Treinish
