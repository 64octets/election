Hi,

I'd like to announce my candidacy for the RPM Packaging for OpenStack PTL.
During the Liberty cycle I've been co-PTL'ing this together with Ha√Økel
Guemar as a bootstrap. For the Mitaka cycle we've been notified that this
setup needs to be adjusted to a single PTL. Therefore we discussed this
and decided that I'd be announcing the candicacy.

We've been mostly quiet on the mailing lists so far because we've been
working together on unifying our existing packaging in order to iron out the
differences for the benefit of being able to develop a common, standardized
packaging for OpenStack on RPM base. As such, the work was mostly on the
side of downstream adjustments in order to have a common state that can be
maintained upstream. We have also spent significant amount of time in
designing a solution that fits for all interested parties, and are just
starting to upstream the bits for it. For us it is important that
we can continue to work as we do right now under the OpenStack Big Tent in
order to reach a critical mass in the project during the next cycle.

My goal for the next cycle is to support the "bootstrapping" phase as much
as possible by ensuring that we can develop a common packaging standard
across all rpm based OpenStack distributions and are actually converging
the downstream effort into those common packagings. For that we have many
open action items that I'm aware of:

* Improve documentation and transparency of the project
* Foster collaboration on the existing spec files and motivate relevant
  groups to contribute back to us
* Design and Implement a gating policy on changes to the project
* Reach the critical mass for the project so that it can self-sustain
  in the future

I'd like to work on all of them together with the other core members
and anyone who is interested in contributing to the project during
the next cycle.

Thanks,
Dirk
