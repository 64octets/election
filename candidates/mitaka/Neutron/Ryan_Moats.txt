I'd like to announce my candidacy for the Mitaka cycle as Neutron PTL. 

While not currently a Neutron core, I've been looking at hard at Neutron for several cycles now and I feel that while we've accomplished a great deal, more consolidation at this point will be desirable. Therefore, if elected, my goals for the Mitaka cycle will be:

1. Continue the decomposition efforts that Kyle has championed up through the Liberty cycle.
2. Improve the performance and reliability of existing reference solutions so that operators can be more confident when deploying neutron.
3. Like Liberty, we have a large list of new items for the design summit [1], which we will work to pare down into items that can be delivered in Mitaka

Thanks,
Ryan Moats
