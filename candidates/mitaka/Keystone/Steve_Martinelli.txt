Hey everyone,

After contributing consistently to Keystone since the Grizzly release, I'd
like to run for the Keystone PTL position for the Mikata release cycle.

I've been a core contributor to Keystone since Icehouse and have largely
been focused on improving Keystone’s ability to integrate with enterprise
environments. I was a significant contributor to Keystone’s federation
support, adding capabilities such as SAML and OpenID Connect enablement,
Keystone to Keystone federation support, and I have had the pleasure of
collaborating with folks from CERN, RackSpace, HP, Red Hat, and U. Kent
on all these initiatives. In addition I have added cloud auditing support
to Keystone. In my spare time, I have served as a core contributor to
OpenStackClient, Oslo Policy, Oslo Cache and pyCADF. I’ve also contributed
small patches to various other OpenStack projects, such as Docs, Horizon,
Oslo, Infra, DevStack and whatever else was needed at the time.

All of this would be for not if it wasn’t without the exceptional Keystone
core team and its extended team. They are truly fantastic folks, and I’ve
been honored to serve under Morgan and Dolph for the last two and a half
years. Thanks to their mentoring I feel this is the right time for me to serve
as PTL. I am fortunate enough to work for an employer that would allow me to
focus 100% of my time on the role of PTL.

I've also helped many new developers contribute to OpenStack and Keystone, and
have always tried to be available to other OpenStack teams to ensure the other
projects have the support from Keystone they need in order to succeed.

Some of my goals for the Mikata cycle are:

  - Continue our track record of striving to be an extremely stable project
  - Stride to make v3 the go-to API and finally deprecate v2.0!
  - Improvements on the federated identity use-cases
  - Continue the work being done in Hierarchical multi-tenancy and Reseller
  - Release a version of keystoneclient that no longer includes the
    session/auth/CLI code
  - General cleanup and paying down technical debt:
    - Deprecate PKI tokens in favor of Fernet tokens
    - Remove the concept of extensions, and instead mark features as
      experimental or stable
    - Create a functional test suite for more advanced Keystone configurations

Finally, I think it’s important that as PTL time is spent on non-technical
duties such as improving the growth and vitality of the OpenStack community in
the following ways:

  - Actively seek out the input and feedback from operators and deployers
  - Mentoring others to become future core contributors and project team leads
  - Ensuring I act as a point of contact for other OpenStack projects
  - Continue to foster the healthy environment we have created in the Keystone
    team and OpenStack as a whole
