Hi All,

We have had a few cycles recently of massive technical churn. We moved 
away from an API, an method of updating DNS entries on the servers, got
incubated and survived the move to the big tent, and are now getting much more
integrated into the OpenStack ecosystem with Heat resources, Neutron work, 
among other things.

We have had great leadership for this period, I am sorry to see Kiall leave 
the PTL role he has performed so well over these cycles.

I have been contributing to Designate since the Havana release, and was made a 
member of core quite a while ago. We have managed to bring together a great 
group of people who contribute to Designate, and I would hope to keep growing 
our community over the next cycle.

I want to focus on a few things this cycle, which I think will help us move 
onward and upward:

- Documentation

We have some great code, but sometimes we lack instructions would that allow 
others to use it to their full potential

- Drivers

We have a few Drivers for different DNS servers, and while we currently have
a grading scheme, I think we need to ensure they are all fully tested, either 
in the gate or in 3rd party testing.

- The Big Rename

We need to do this asap (as soon as we go into M development), and remove all 
trace of "domains" from the code base.

If elected I would try to work on these issues, and any others that may 
(aka will) pop up in the cycle, while trying to get more people into the
designate community.

Thank you,

Graham
