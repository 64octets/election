Hi everyone,

We've come a long way in the last cycle, taking us on a challenging journey
which is starting to reap rewards. I would like the opportunity to serve the
community as PTL in the Mitaka cycle with the following aims:

1. Grow the community
   I would like to increase our community participation through the engagement
   with other OpenStack Projects and the Operator community. I believe that
   it's crucial to the success of the project to increase the diversity of
   contributors and I'd like this to be a focus for the cycle.

2. Improve modularity
   The project has built Ansible roles which are re-usable outside of the
   defined use-cases which we do integration testing with. This, however, is
   not obvious to anyone unless they spend a fair amount of time investigating
   the playbooks and roles. I would like to reduce this barrier to entry by
   moving towards a 'Big Tent' concept for our roles, with each role being
   in its own repository, tested independently and fully re-usable in
   a design of the deployers choosing.

3. Improve platform support enablement
   Fairly common feedback from deployers has been that they like the project,
   but would prefer to deploy on an alternative Operating System. While the
   door has always been open for a contributor to put a patch up for review,
   it is important that we acknowledge that this is not as simple a task as it
   could be. I would like us to put some energy into lowering the barrier to
   entry for this task to make it simpler to achieve.

4. Improve usability
   Through improvements to our playbooks, roles and documentation, I believe
   that OpenStack-Ansible can be made simpler and easier to develop for, to
   deploy and to operate.

I look forward to working with you all for the next cycle and hope that we can
meet our lofty goals!
