Hello,

This will be the first official PTL election for Cue, and I would be
honored to serve another term leading the project for the M Cycle.

Cue is a relatively new project in Openstack, and was approved into the
Big Tent during Liberty.  I have been involved with Cue from the
beginning, from initial POC to having a product that is production
worthy.  In my past life, iâ€™ve been a member of the Trove Core team.

During the Liberty Cycle, Cue has become a solid product with a
control plane that can manage per-tenant RabbitMQ Clusters.  We spent
a lot of time beefing up our tests, and boast >90% unit test coverage.
We also added Tempest tests, and Rally tests, including gating jobs
for both.  Our documentation has also been revamped considerably, and
allows new contributors to ramp up quickly with the project.

During the M cycle, I would like to focus on building a community and
getting additional contributors to Cue.  I would also like to focus
the team on multi-broker support, including adding Kafka as a broker
that is managed by Cue.

I believe Cue has come a long ways in a short time, and going forward
has the opportunity accelerate the growth in terms of features,
quality, and adoption.

Thanks for your consideration!
