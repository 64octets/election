Howdy folks,

I'd like to propose myself for oslo PTL for the mitaka cycle,

For those that don't know me I've been involved in openstack for ~4 years,

Have worked at yahoo! for ~7 years, ~4 of the last years have been getting openstack adopted in
yahoo! (where it is now used by everyone, and is a common  word/name/project all employees know
about, quite a change from when 3 other engineers and myself started investigating it 4 years ago).
It has been quite the  journey (for myself, others and yahoo! in general) and I've been pretty
active in oslo for ~2 years so I thought it might be a good time to try to run and see how I  can
help in a PTL role (this also ensures nobody else in oslo-core burns out).

I contribute to many projects (inside and outside of openstack):

- http://stackalytics.com/report/users/harlowja

Created/maintain/co-maintain/contributor/core to the following:

(not directly openstack, generally useful to all)
- https://kazoo.readthedocs.org
- https://redis-py.readthedocs.org
- https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org
- https://fasteners.readthedocs.org
- https://pymemcache.readthedocs.org
- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zake
- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/doc8
- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/retrying
(mainly created for usage by openstack, but not limited to)
- https://anvil.readthedocs.org
- http://docs.openstack.org/developer/futurist/
- http://docs.openstack.org/developer/automaton/
- http://docs.openstack.org/developer/debtcollector/
- http://docs.openstack.org/developer/taskflow/
- http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tooz/
(created for usage by openstack)
- oslo.messaging
- oslo.utils
- oslo.serialization
- oslo.service
- (all the other 'oslo.*' libraries)
(and more...)

I feel I can help bring a unique viewpoint to oslo and openstack in general; one of increasing
exposure and general usefulness of oslo libraries outside of  openstack; fostering community inside
and outside and continuing to make oslo and openstack the best it can be.

Some of the things that I would like to focus on (not inclusive of all the things):

- Increasing outreach to consuming projects so that they can benefit from the oslo libraries, code and
knowledge (and patterns) that have been built up by these  libraries; perhaps some kind of bi-weekly blog
about oslo?
- Improving our outreach to others in the wider world (even ones not in the big tent); the python community
is a big world and it'd be great to make sure we do our  part there as well.
- Being jolly.
- Asking the hard questions.

Thanks for considering me,

-Joshua Harlow
