Hello everyone,

I have had the pleasure to be involved with the RefStack team at a
very early state and to witness its growth from a Stackforge project
to a "Big Tent" project!  The RefStack project has come a long way
and has made significant progress.  Still, there are tons of work
that need to be continued and challenges that need to be overcome on
this long journey to make OpenStack Interoperability a reality.  This
is the reason why I want to raise my hand again and propose my
candidacy for RefStack PTL.

Thanks to a small but dedicated team, we have accomplished our initial
goals in:
1) Providing a simple and easy to use test harness to enable users/vendors
   to run tests on their clouds.
2) Building a test result collection and reporting service to support
   the DefCore testing process.

In the Mitaka cycle, I see our priorities being:
1) Grow the RefStack team.
2) Expand refstack-client test coverage by including in-tree gate tests
   which are runnable under Tempest.
3) Implement a vendor registration process to facilitate the publishing of
   results data with vendor association.
4) Statistics analysis of the collected result data.

I appreciate your vote,  and I am looking forward to bringing our team and
project to the next successful level.

Catherine
