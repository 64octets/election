Hello everyone,

I'm announcing my candidacy for Cinder PTL for the Mitaka release.

First of all, I would like to thank John and Mike for their great and hard
work making Cinder such a great project with good and a big community.

As a Cinder community we made a great progress not only with new features,
but with improving Cinder quality too. Our community grows quickly and
we are glad to see new contributors again and again.

I've started work with OpenStack since Diablo release. Iâ€™ve been an active
contributor to Cinder since Juno cycle [1].

As a Cinder PTL I would like to focus on the following areas of improvements
for the next release cycle:

* Finally move all projects to Cinder API v2 and prepare to remove v1 API.

* Better Cinder integration with other OpenStack projects like Nova and
  Ironic, support Keystone API v3.

* Continue to work on Cinder backups improvements like: scaling, performance,
  etc.

* Work with driver vendors to stabilize third party CI. I believe,
  every PTL candidate will have this item on the list.

* Improve Cinder test coverage and quality: we need to get functional tests,
  better Tempest and Rally coverage, make our unit tests better

We need to continue to be open for developers community and operators
needs. Improving quality and growing the community are the tasks which should
be done indefinitely. But we need to keep balance between new features
development and support of existing ones by all drivers and stability of
Cinder project.
