Cinder community,

I am announcing my candidacy for Cinder PTL for the Mitaka release.

Cinder is a fundamental piece of the puzzle for the success
of OpenStack.  I've been lucky enough to work on Cinder since the
Grizzly release cycle.  The Cinder community has grown every release,
and we've gotten a lot of great features implemented as well as many
new drivers.  We've instituted a baseline requirement for third party
CI, which is critical to the quality of Cinder.  I believe this goes
a long way to proving to deployers that Cinder is dedicated to building
a quality product.

I believe the single best component of the project, is the diverse 
community itself.  We have people from all over the world helping
Cinder grow.  We have companies that compete directly with each other,
in the marketplace for customers, working together to solve complex
problems.  

I would like to continue to encourage more driver developers to get
involved in Cinder core features.   This is the future of the
community itself and the lifeblood of Cinder.  We also need to get more
active in Nova to ensure that the interactions are stable.

The following is a list of a few areas of focus that I would
like to encourage the community to consider over the next release.

* Solidify all/any deadlines milestone deadlines early in the release
* Iron out the Nova <--> Cinder interactions
* Get active-active c-vol services working
* Get driver bug fixes into previous releases
* Continue the stabilization of the 3rd party CI system.
* Support any efforts to integrate with Ironic


There is always a long list of cool stuff to work on and issues to fix
in Cinder, and the more participation we have with Cinder core the better.
We have a strong and vibrant community and I look forward to working on 
Cinder for many releases ahead.

Thank you for considering me.
