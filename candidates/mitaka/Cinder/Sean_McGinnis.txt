Hello everyone,

I'm announcing my candidacy for Cinder PTL for the Mitaka release.

The Cinder team has made great progress. We've not only grown the
number of supported backend drivers, but we've made significant
improvements to the core code and raised the quality of existing
and incoming code contributions. While there are still many things
that need more polish, we are headed in the right direction and
block storage is a strong, stable component to many OpenStack clouds.

Mike and John have provided the leadership to get the project where
it is today. I would like to keep that momentum going.

I've spent over a decade finding new and interesting ways to create
and delete volumes. I also work across many different product teams
and have had a lot of experience collaborating with groups to find
a balance between the work being done to best benefit all involved.

I think I can use this experience to foster collaboration both within
the Cinder team as well as between Cinder and other related projects
that interact with storage services.

Some topics I would like to see focused on for the Mitaka release
would be:

 * Complete work of making the Cinder code Python3 compatible.
 * Complete conversion to objects.
 * Sort out object inheritance and appropriate use of ABC.
 * Continued stabilization of third party CI.
 * Make sure there is a good core feature set regardless of backend type.
 * Reevaluate our deadlines to make sure core feature work gets enough
   time and allows drivers to implement support.

While there are some things I think we need to do to move the project
forward, I am mostly open to the needs of the community as a whole
and making sure that what we are doing is benefiting OpenStack and
making it a simpler, easy to use, and ubiquitous platform for the 
cloud.

Thank you for your consideration!
