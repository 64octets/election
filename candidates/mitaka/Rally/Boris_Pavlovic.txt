My name is Boris.

I'm announcing my candidacy for Rally PTL for the Mitaka release.

Few years ago I started Rally to help OpenStack community to simplify
performance/load/scale/volume testing of OpenStack and actually make it simple
to answer on question: "How OpenStack perform (in ones very specific case)".

Rally team did a terrific job to make from just a small initial 100 line
script, project that you can see now.

It covers most of the user cases, has plugins for most of the projects, high
quality of code & docs, as well it's simple to install/use/integrate and it
works quite stable.

However we are in the middle of our path and there are plenty of places that
should be improved:

* New input task format - that address all current issues
    https://github.com/openstack/rally/blob/master/doc/specs/in-progress/new_rally_input_task_format.rst

* Multi scenario load generation
     That will allow us to do the monitoring with testing, HA testing under
     load and load from many "different" types of workloads.

* Scaling up Rally DB
     This will allow users to run non stop  workloads for days or generate
     really huge distributed load for a quite long amount of time

* Distributed load generation
     Generation of really huge load like 100k rps

* Workloads framework
    Benchmarking that measures performance of Servers, VMs, Network and Volumes

* ...infinity list from here:
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/16DXpfbqvlzMFaqaXAcJsBzzpowb_XpymaK2aFY2gA2g/edit#gid=0


In other words I would like to continue to work as PTL of Rally until
we get all this done.
