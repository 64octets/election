I, also known as "Daisy", would like to continue as the I18n PTL,
if you will have me.

I had a great time as the I18n PTL in Liberty,
working with the whole team to make important changes happen.
I would like to have another term to stabilize them.

In June, I18n project became an official project.
Translation contributors are treated the same as code contributors.
30+ active translators are regarded as ATC's in Liberty.
It is a great milestone for I18n team and translators.
We are getting more official and more visible.

In July, we started the trial of the new tool -Zanata,
which is a open source based and OpenStack hosted traslation website.
After a long time evaluation and improvement, in September,
we officially migrated translations to Zanata.
49 language teams are created and 130+ translators have been registered.
Now we are running Liberty translation there.

In September, we kicked off Liberty translation, which is under
processing now. It's the first time that we translate on top of Zanata,
the first time that we include Nova in the translation plan,
and the first time we formally use two phases of string freeze.
I'm trying my best to make sure everything is running well.
When Liberty translation is done, we could review how we did and how
to make them better.

In Mitaka, I'm going to focus on blew items:

1. Get official recognization to translators
I'm going to add translation metric in stackalytics,
and automate the process to award active translators "ATC"

2. Improve translation quality
I'm going to improve the list of translation terminologies, promote
its broad adoption in all language teams.
I'm going to boost the enablement of translation check website.

3. Better cooperation with development team and documentation team

I welcome any good ideas which could help the team to achieve
these goals. Hope to get your support for my PTL role in Mitaka.
I am honored to work with everyone to build up a better I18n project.

Thank you.
Daisy
