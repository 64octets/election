Moving Puppet OpenStack modules under the big tent was an amazing opportunity
for us to make sure our project remains Open [1].
Liberty was our first cycle where we were part of OpenStack and we can
be proud of what we achieved together [2].

We've built a community coming from two different worlds: developers and
operators. We need to keep that, because I think that's what is making the
difference today when you're deploying OpenStack: you need a short loop feedback
between both worlds.

Being OpenStack is not that easy, and we have great challenges
in front of us.

* Documentation
I would like to put emphasis on having more documentation
so we can more easily welcome new contributors and hopefuly get more adoption.
I truly believe more documentation will help our contributors
to get quickly involved and eventually give a chance to scale-up our team.
Our users deserve more guidance to understand best practices when using our
modules, that should also be part of this effort.

* Continuous Integration
We did a lot of work on CI, on both beaker & integration jobs. I would like
to continue integration work and test more OpenStack modules.
I would like to continue collaboration with Tempest team and keep using it
for testing. I'm also interested by multi-node and upgrade testing, that would
make stronger how we develop the modules.

* Release management
I would like to reach a better release velocity by trying to stay close to
OpenStack releases (especially from packaging).
As soon as major distributions release stable packaging, I think we should
provide a release.

* Community
I would like to continue the collaboration with other projects, mostly OpenStack
Infrastructure (for Continuous Integration work), TripleO, Fuel, Kolla (container
integration), Documentation, Tempest (for puppet-openstack-integration
work) and packagers (Ubuntu Cloud Archive and RDO teams).
This collaboration is making OpenStack better and is the reason of our success
today. We need to continue that way by coordinating groups and maintaining good
communications.


I had the immense pleasure to lead our team during the last few months and I would
like to continue my role of PTL for the next cycle.
Thank you for your time and consideration,
