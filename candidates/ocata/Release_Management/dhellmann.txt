I am announcing my candidacy for PTL for the Release Management team
for the Ocata release cycle.

During Newton we successfully split out the Requirements Management
team, which now has enough active members to maintain a healthy review
rate for requirements changes.  The team also made significant
progress in our automation goals during Newton, and I would like to
serve again to see that work through the next phase.

My goals for Ocata include automating stable branch creation through
reviews, as we did with tags; smoothing out a few rough edges in what
we've already implemented for automating tags and releases; and
continuing our documentation work to make the end-of-cycle process
more repeatable and reliable. I would also like for us to finish the
work in reno and pbr to support embedding the release notes build
information in our source distributions.
