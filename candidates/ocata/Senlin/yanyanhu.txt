Hi, All,

I would like to nominate myself for the PTL of Senlin project for Ocata cycle.

I worked on Senlin project since it was setup in Dec. 2014. I'm very pleased
to work with the team in last two years and very appreciated for the previous
PTL Qiming's hard work to lead us in correct way and bridge Senlin with other
projects in the community.

We have achieved several important milestones in Newton cycle including:
 - Basic health management support
 - Container cluster support
 - Micro-versioned API interface
 - Tempest test for both API, functional and integration scenarios
 - Complete API reference and user/development document

Hopefully we will have partial support for message type of receiver landed as
well.

I think our foucs for next release may include:
 - More complete HA support with practical use case as reference
 - Versioning support for policy, profile
 - Unified version management for API, DB, and Senlin resources
 - Event notification to allow user to track important workflows of Senlin
   service
 - Complete support for container cluster and container scheduling
 - More test cases for integration and benchmarking scenarios

I will be very honored if I can get your support to play the role of PTL in
Ocata cycle. I believe we will achieve our goals and make Senlin better.

Thanks for your consideration!

Sincerely yours,
Yanyan Hu
