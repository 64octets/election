Hi all,

I've had the pleasure of serving the Zaqar community as PTL for the past two
cycles, and I'd like to continue for Ocata cycle, if you'll have me.

For Ocata release, things I'd like to do:

1. Real-world deployment
   Puppet and Ansible Zaqar are ready. And we have got many interests for
Zaqar's production deployment. Some of them are doing evaluation, so we need to
support them in Ocata and try to make them happen.

2. Notification service
   We have partially landed the subscription confirmation feature in Newton, so
let's get it done in Ocata. Notification delivery policy is another good one to
have.

3. Collaboration with other OpenStack projects
   We did a great job in Newton to support trust subscriber, which means any
OpenStack services can be used as a subscriber of Zaqar and being secured.
And I believe there are some other projects could be benefited by Zaqar from
their view. For example, the notification middleware of Swift, Zaqar's
websocket transport for Searchlight/Horizon etc.

4. More contributors
   We got some new members joined the team in Newton. And some of them has been
nominated as core reviewer who grew very fast. It's really awesome. In
Ocata, I would like to encourage more people/organizations to join Zaqar
community to make sure we have a good coverage.

It's a fantastic experience working with this amazing team and I know without
the dedication and hard work of everyone who has contributed to Zaqar we can't
make those success stories of Newton happen. I would be pleased to serve
as PTL for another cycle and I'd appreciate your vote.

Thanks for your consideration!
