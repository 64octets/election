Hello everyone,

I would like to announce my candidacy to continue to serve as RefStack PTL for
the Ocata cycle.

For the Newton development cycle, we have started implementing new features
allowing vendor and product registration at RefStack.  These are foundation
elements for the future features such as: enabling centralized testing, perform
statistical analysis of the collected result data, etc. Consequently, our team
has been extremely diligent in reviewing every specifications and their
implementation to ensure that appropriate approaches were chosen for the
circumstances.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for your
effort and valuable contribution in the Newton cycle!

We have made a lot of progress.  Nevertheless, there are still a lot of work
that needs to be continued. As such, I would like to serve once again as the
RefStack team PTL to complete the vendor and product registration
implementations.

For the Ocata cycle, our focus will be as follows:

1) Complete vendor/product registration implementation.
2) Establish and implement test result data retention policy.
3) Add new features to allow vendor (customized) guidelines.
4) Define centralized testing blueprints, specifications and implementation (if
   time permits).

I look forward to work with all of you.  Thank you for your consideration!

Catherine Diep
