Hi Kuryrs,

First of all, I want to thank Gal for the hard work done in the past two cycles
as PTL for the project and to all of you who have contributed in any and many
ways, be it either in documentation, code, bugs, design, discussion and usage.

I announce my candidacy to the Kuryr PTL position with the goal of bringing
Kuryr to fulfill its mission of bringing OpenStack networking and storage to
the container world. The way in which I believe we should do it is mainly by
continuing to increase the community participation in the day to day of the
project evolution.

In order to take Kuryr to the next stage, the goals that I'd like us to focus
on are:

- Make it easier for people to develop Kuryr with kuryr-kubernetes devstack.
- Increased testing for kuryr-libnetwork and start to have end to end testing
for kuryr-kubernetes.
- Now that we implemented a core contribution specialization in four groups:
  + fuxi,
  + kuryr-core,
  + kuryr-libnetwork,
  + kuryr-kubernetes.
  We should get more people familiar enough with each project to be able to
promote them to core contributors.
- Increase the attention on bug tracking and release management.
- Reach Container-in-VM support.
- Participate more in upstream container orchestration engine communities.

I look forward to work with all of you to make Kuryr into the things all of
us want and need from it.
