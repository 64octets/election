I am writing to submit my candidacy for re-election as the PTL for the
Trove project (Ocata cycle). I have been an active technical
contributor to the Trove project since just before the Icehouse
release when Trove was integrated into OpenStack. I have also
contributed code[1] and reviews[2] to some other OpenStack projects,
and have been an active participant in the Stewardship Working Group
[3] (SWG) and a not-so active participant in the Delimiter project.

Ocata is a short cycle, and based on some discussions within the
community, and feedback from users, I believe that we should continue
to build on the progress and improvements that we were able to acheive
in the Newton cycle, and focus on:

- paying down our technical debt, including specifically some long
  standing items that were listed by the TC at the time when Trove was
  integrated, and improving our testing, addressing some long standing
  issues with dependencies between the server and the client, and

- making it easier to use Trove by delivering tools to simplify guest
  image creation, and improving the commands and API for registering
  datastores and images, and

- improving the Trove API documentation, and

- strengthen the community and foster new members and companies who
  wish to contribute to Trove, and work closely with new participants
  to improve their experiences using Trove, and

- adding support for clustering in some databases (potentially
  Couchbase), refactoring the guestagent for PostgreSQL, supporting
  cluster upgrades, anding add support for additional database
  versions (like MySQL 5.7).

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all members of the
development community who helped the Trove project during the Newton
cycle; those who contributed code and reviews to the project as well
as members of the infra, release, stable, oslo, docs, dib, and other
project teams who helped us on innumerable occasions.

Thank you, and I appreciate your support in the election.
