I'd like to continue to serve as the Stable branch maintenance PTL.

The role for the Stable team has changed slightly in the last few cycles.  As a result of tooling improvements made in the juno/kilo timeframes the stable gate has been more solid.  This means that the stable team is able to look in slightly different areas.

Here are some of the things on my TODO list for Stable branch maintenance
 - Work with project teams to understand how decisions taken on master will
   impact their stable branches.  Specifically projects with a driver model.
 - Work with project teams to implement constraints support
 - Growing the project specific, and stable-maint teams
 - Re-establishing regular team meetings and presence in #openstack-stable
 - Producing tooling to aid projects teams, release managers and the stable
   team to keep stable branches current and released with a regular cadence
 - Producing tooling and procedures to help retire projects as required

If the team and community will have me I'm happy to serve again.
