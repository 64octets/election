I’m writing to announce my candidacy for Congress PTL (Ocata).

First, I’d like to thank Tim for his outstanding leadership since the very
beginning of the project.  Under his leadership, Congress has grown from an
interesting idea to a capable service.  I would also like to thank everyone for
their tremendous support in bringing me along as a Congress contributor, from
first learning the codebase to leading the high-availability design and
implementation efforts.  I’m truly grateful to be a part of such a welcoming,
collaborative and supportive community.

For the Ocata cycle, my main focus for Congress is usability and
ease-of-adoption.  For example, by shipping Congress with pre-built policies
and templates, Congress would provide useful policy-based monitoring fresh
out-of-the-box, its time-to-value improving from weeks to under a day.  I also
aim to continue prioritizing user engagement, cross-project collaboration, and
code robustness.  Last but not least, I look forward to supporting our project
members in their goals and visions for Congress.

Thank you all once again!
