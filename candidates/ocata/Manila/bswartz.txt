I am running again for the position of Manila PTL.

Newton didn't go as well as it could have and I would like
to make some changes in Ocata (even though it's a short release)
about how we prioritize work as a community and I would like to
change the current set of deadlines and processes to help focus
the team instead of allowing us to be overwhelmed with new
feature proposals.

I've already started gathering feedback from the core reviewers
and I will make a proposal after the election. Whether I win or
lose, I have ideas for how to do less but to do it better, rather
than trying to do everything and doing nothing well.
