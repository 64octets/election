I would like to propose my candidacy for the Monasca PTL. 

I have been the PTL on Monasca for the Newton release, and I would
like to continue on. During the Newton cycle we added a significant
number of new features, improved performance dramatically, completed
the initial integration of Cassandra, added monasca-transform,
added monasca-analytics, better integrated with Heat and many others.
The Monasca community is extremeley productive.

My goals and objectives for the project in the Ocata release are as follows:

* Wrap-up reviews in-progress that improve the performance and
interactivity of metrics, measurments and statistics queries.

* Continue to work on performance enhancements.

* Continue to enhance the Cassandra implementation by addressing
performance improvements and compression.

* Continue to develop monasca-analytics and address several use cases in
more depth.

* Continue to integrate with other OpenStack projects.

* Evangelize Monasca and grow the developer and operator base.

* Facilitate the development eco-system.

* Write more code.
