Hello everyone!

I'd like to announce my candidacy for PTL position of the Data
Processing program (Sahara).

I'm working on Sahara project since Juno release, and since Mitaka release
I'm the member of the Sahara core reviewer team. I'm also PTL of Sahara
for Newton release.

My focus as a PTL will be coordination of reaching community goals, managing
Sahara releases, and tracking all activities related to new features
in Sahara. And also I will try to bring new folks in sahara. Stabilization
of CI is also a high priority for our team.

I hope that Sahara will continue growing in Ocata release.

Best regards, Vitaly Gridnev
