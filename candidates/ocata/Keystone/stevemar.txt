Hey everyone,

I'd like to continue to serve as the PTL of the keystone project for the Ocata
release. I served as PTL of the keystone project for the Mitaka and Newton
development cycles. I find the role to be extremely rewarding, and would be
honoured to continue to serve in the same capacity, if you'll have me.

During the Mitaka development cycle we accomplished many blueprints and hit
some important goals, here are a few off the top of my head:

  - Python 3 compatibility (for unit tests)
  - Credential encryption
  - PCI support for passwords
  - Running migration tests on non-sqlite backends
  - API docs are migrated and fully updated
  - Introduced the `keystone doctor` helper

For the Ocata release I'd like to take advantage the short development cycle
to aggressively pay down some of the technical debt we've accumulated and
also improve user and operator experience. I'd like to limit new features to a
minimum (maybe 3-5) my short list is the following:

  - Multi Factor Auth (MFA) support
  - Improving the federated identity mapping engine
  - Tackle the issue with long running operations timing out
  - Handle federated authentication without apache libraries
  - Functional tests with non-standard deployments (ldap, federated identity)

With the exception of MFA support, all the features listed above match the
theme of paying down technical debt or improving user experience.

From a non-technical perspective, I'd like to do the following:

  - Improve communication and engagement with our direct downstream consumers
    (OSA, tripleo, etc)
  - Continue to work with operators. Create specifications based on real world
    use cases that are driven by operators facing issues with performance,
    usability, scalability, and upgrades.
  - Appoint a bug czar or perform weekly bug triages and monthly bug squashes

Lastly, I'd like to thank anyone that contributed to keystone during the Newton
release. I'm very excited for what Ocata will bring and look forward to working
on it in any capacity.
