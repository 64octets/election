I am running for re-election as the OpenStackClient PTL.

We accomplished some major milestones in the last term:
* Release 3.0
* Many new Network commands
* Filled many gaps in Volume support
* Extract osc-lib from the base OSC code
* Re-structure the authentication layer to fully utilize
  os-client-config (clouds.yaml support) and KeystoneAuth plugins
* Participated in a UX study in Austin that helped understand how
  users approach using OpenStackClient and OpenStack as a whole.

In the coming releases we hope to:
* Revise the plugin interface to allow plugins to hook in to common
  commands, such as quota set/show
* Add support for higher-layer value-add commands, such as a project
  purge command that can remove all resources owned by a project across
  all APIs (this also requires the revised plugin interface)
* Continue to address performance issues, specifically with start-up time.
  This includes removing dependencies and duplicated functionality.
* Move more command implementations to utilise the OpenStack SDK once it
  reaches a 1.0 release.  (This also reduces dependencies.)
* Expand the implementation of list command options --sort, --marker and
  --limit to commands where it is not intrinsically included in the
  underlying API by implementing it locally to provide a common user
  interface for all list commands.
* Continue to migrate useful common code into osc-lib for use by
  plugins and stand-alone CLIs.  This includes basic command support
  code that is not API-specific.
* Participate in another UX study in Barcelona specifically geared to
  address ambiguous command structures.

The os-client-config library is also included in the OpenStackClient
project.  Our plans for it in the near future are:
* Refactor the primary configuration functionality to allow flexibility
  to support different needs in calling applications, such as the order
  of operations and plugin loading.
* Collect all of the 'magic' configuration bits used in multiple apps
  in one place so we can converge support for common user expectations.

Most of all, I want to see us continue our mission of providing a
(wait for it...) consistent interface to OpenStack via the CLI.
Sometimes this means changing how we think about certain operations
in individual projects, sometimes it means providing direction for new
operations, and mostly it means finding the common ground that makes
our users lives simpler.

I thank you and am honored by your support.
