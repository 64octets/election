I propose my candidacy for the Neutron PTL for the Ocata cycle.

I am not quite burned out yet, and I have still some incomplete business
which I would to finish off before I step down.

This is it: I am not writing anymore but that's not because I am becoming
sloppy. You can look for yourself what we have accomplished since I started
steering the ship with my mates. Some pointers:

http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/#newton
http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/#mitaka
http://grafana.openstack.org/dashboard/db/neutron-failure-rate
http://governance.openstack.org/reference/projects/neutron.html

You can see that we have become razor focused and able to deliver on most
of our committments. I am sure your curiosity can take you elsewhere to
find out more about how we rock and what we can improve.

Thanks,
Armando
