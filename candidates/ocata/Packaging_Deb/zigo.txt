I am writing to submit my candidacy for re-election as the PTL for the
packaging-deb project.

The idea sparked in Vancouver (spring 2015). The project joined the
big-tent about a year ago (in August 2015, it was approved by the TC)
But it then took about a year to have it bootstraped. This was long and
painful bootstrap, but today, I can proudly announce that it was finally
well launched. Right now, all of Oslo and python-*client are built, and
it is a mater of days until all services of Newton is completely built
in OpenStack infra (Keystone is already there in Newton b2 version).

I'll do my best to continue to drive the project, and hope to gather
more contribution every day. Every contributor counts.

Cheers,

Thomas Goirand (zigo)

P.S: It maybe will be a bit hard to find out who can vote, because only
the debian/newton branch should count, and currently Stackalytics is
counting the master which contains upstream commits. Hopefully, we can
solve the issue before the elections.
