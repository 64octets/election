I'm Renat Akhmerov. I would like to announce my candidacy for being a PTL of
Mistral Workflow Service in Ocata cycle.

I think Mistral now is a pretty mature project which provides really useful
and cool capabilities. The project now is moving into the phase when technical
perfection should be the number one priority. In many case Mistral serves as
one of the central infrastructural components. To be able to build production
ready solutions on top of Mistral it needs to be reliable, demonstrate
excellent performance, provide good usability and comprehensive documentation.

Here are my priorities for Ocata cycle:

* Performance. In Newton cycle we made Mistral work about 30 times faster.
  Now it's able to complete a workflow consisting of hundreds of tasks with
  highly parallel structure and lots of join operations during tens of
  seconds or less depending on workflow actions. That's not all, there's
  still a potential to do even better and also improve Mistral when dealing
  with parallel loads.
* Scaling. Although it's now possible to scale Mistral engine tier we still
  need to improve when having a high load.
* Extensibility. We started working on Custom Action API which will allow
  writing custom Mistral actions in a more flexible, elegant and powerful
  way. We're planning to finish this work in Ocata cycle.
* Usability and documentation. There are some gaps in Mistral documentation.
  User experience, especially CLI, also needs to be improved. We finally
  started gathering ideas for new CLI and API versions in Newton cycle.
* Building even more robust and diverse community.

I'd like to welcome everyone who wants to help with Mistral development.
We'll provide all necessary assistance.
