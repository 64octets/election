I'd like to continue to serve as the OpenStack Requirements PTL.

Since the Austin summit the requirements team has worked to reduced tech debt
and improve gating of constraints updates.  This has reduced the number of
fires after new OpenStack library updates.  We still have several items in
front of us.  Continuing with the themes for my recent election:

In rough priority order:
 - Improving communication, often decisions are made in the requirements team
   that affect many projects, I have a commitment to bringing more experts in
   for strategic reviews/discussions
 - Understand how we can work with/enhance pip tooling to create a more
   satisfactory requirements/constraints experience for OpenStack
 - Work closely with the release managers as there is still a lot of common
   issues there.  In that a release of $project will trigger processes in the
   requirements team.
 - Getting openstack_requirements *code* to the point it can be installed as a
   library.  We've seen issues in the past where stable branches need largish
   backports to work correctly.  Really the *code* and *data* should be treated
   independently
 - Testing lower bounds of our supported requirements [lower-constraints.txt]

If the team and community will have me I'm happy to serve again.
