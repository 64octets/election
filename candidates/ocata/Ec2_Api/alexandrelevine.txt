Hi all,

I am the current PTL for the EC2 API project and I'm the one who drove its
implementation and adoption as a standalone project (previously it was a
part of nova). I would like to nominate myself as a PTL for the next cycle.

Last cycle we tried to keep up with the changes in Amazon and to contribute
necessary additions to nova so that we can support some of the lacking
features. The last part didn't succeed so we'll try again.

The next cycle we'll try to:

1. Again submit required changes to nova.
2. Fix bugs and support clients.
3. Consider implementation of some marginal features which we do not support
yet.

Best regards,
  Alex Levine
