Hi All,

I would like to nominate myself to take the role of Heat PTL for the
Ocata cycle.

I have been involved with the project since the last few years, first as a
contributor and then a core reviewer and have had the opportunity to work
with a great team and community. I strongly believe that with ever
increasing adoption of Heat, we are well placed to live up to the
expectations of the end users and OpenStack ecosystem at large, by
continuously evolving, encouraging participation and consensus building.

We achieved some significant milestones in the newton cycle by making
convergence the default architecture and improving on some of the key
non functional areas like stability and performance. I believe we have
more work to do in these areas, when projects like TriplO start using
Heat with convergence enabled.

We have the fortune of having a number of experienced and previous PTLs
in the team that makes the job of a  new PTL easier and I don't see
the PTL anything more than a communication bridge and a team catalyst.

I believe our focus in the Ocata cycle would include:

- Continuously improve the stability and performance
- Upgrades with zero downtime
- Increase/improve the the test coverage without increasing the
  CI time
- Convergence Phase-II
- Validation improvements

And not to mention the run-of-the-mill activities:

- Ensuring that CI jobs are healthy (and we don't break other projects)
- On time releases with efficient coordination and collaboration

I'm sure we would be able to achieve the goals we set for ourselves and
would be happy to work as the team catalyst.

Thank you.
