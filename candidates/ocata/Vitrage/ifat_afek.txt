Hi All,

I would like to announce my candidacy to continue as Vitrage PTL for the Ocata
release.

I've been leading the Vitrage project development from the day it started, in
Mitaka. During this time our team has made tremendous progress, and now we have
a fully-functional RCA service. The project was accepted into the big tent
seven months after it started, in early June this year.

There are few areas I think we should focus on in the Ocata cycle. I believe
the main one is to enlarge our community. New contributors are welcome to join!
To achieve this, we should work on integrations with other OpenStack projects,
and continue our involvement in OPNFV.

Other goals are to increase the project stability, improve the UI, add new
datasources, and better support multi-tenancy use cases and templates CRUD.
The Ocata cycle is very short, but I believe we can achieve most of these
goals.

Looking forward to continue this exciting journey!

Thank you,
Ifat Afek
