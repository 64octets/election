Hi Everyone, I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL for the Freezer
Project during the Ocata Cycle.

The Freezer Team has done an amazing job of getting the Freezer Project to
where it is today. For the last six months, I have been fortunate to have
been a contributing member of the Team, and have worked with some amazing,
talented people. I would like to continue that effort to help the Team move
the project even further along.

I see the PTL role as an enabler of the Team to make the project successful by
assisting the Team in the following ways:

* Drive the feature set under development to enhance the usefulness of the
  project across the OpenStack ecosystem.

* Steer the technical architecture of the Project as much as possible with
  assistance from the Team.

* Facilitate communication between team members by organizing, scheduling, and
  running team meetings and events.

* Handle OpenStack administrative work to allow the Team to focus on
  development, reviews, bug fixes, and documentation.

* Create an inviting welcoming project to enlarge the number of contributors to
  the Team and create a broader community.

* Ensure the quality of the committed code.

* Act as an ambassador to other OpenStack Projects to help facilitate tight
  integration across OpenStack components.

Top priorities for the Ocata cycle would be:

* Move to a plugin architecture so that users of the Freezer service would be
  enabled to extend the Freezer functionality to handle their specific backup
  use cases.

* Begin development on a deduplication feature so that Freezer is on par with
  industrial-strength backup solutions.

* Replace usage of the Elasticsearch DB with MySQL DB to better align with
  OpenStack standards and move to a more appropriate relational model for
  Freezer configuration data.

* Harden the Freezer components so that they are more resilient to failures.

* Continue to improve testing coverage by building out the integration tests
  that have been recently added in the last cycle.

* Work the Karbor Project to help discover integration possibilities
  between Freezer and Karbor.

* Engage in Freezer presentations at the OpenStack Design Summits to
  further Freezer's acceptance and adoption in the OpenStack Community.

I would be honored to have your vote.

Respectfully yours.
