Hi everyone,

I'm happy to announce my candidacy to continue as the Freezer PTL for the
Ocata release cycle.

I think the Freezer team has done an amazing job again during the Newton cycle,
making Freezer more stable, reliable and adding some interesting features.

I want for Ocata to be the cycle where we continue to mature and stabilize
Freezer, but also where we add some meaning full features.


In order to achieve that, I think we should focus on:

* Refactoring the freezer-agent, in order to implement multiple plugin layers.
  This will allow for easy extension of the agent and help support any
  backup scenario.

* Continue the work done this cycle regarding integration tests. This is a good
  start, but we need even more features, options and scenarios to be tested.

* Work with the community and integrate with other projects: openstack-ansible,
  fuel, openstack-puppet, karbor, heat, barbican...

* Documentation. We should aim to continue what we started this cycle and
  improve our documentation.

* Kick off the work on deduplication, a long requested feature and an
  interesting engineering challenge.



I would be honored to have your support again for this cycle.

Thanks,
Pierre (slashme)
