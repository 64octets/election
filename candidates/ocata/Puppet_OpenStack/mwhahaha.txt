I would like to nominate myself for the PTL role in the Puppet Openstack Team
for the Ocata release cycle.

I have been involved in the puppet team since Liberty as both a contributor and
 a downstream consumer.  It has been a pleasure working with the community to
improve and make the Puppet Openstack projects one of the most mature ways to
deploy OpenStack.

For the Ocata cycle, I believe we have a few places to continue to focus.
- Continuing the work that Emilien has promoted, we need to continue to focus
  on CI integration both upstream and downstream.
- We need to ensure that the new modules in the project continue to mature and
  are included in CI.
- Improving documentation around established patterns and best practices.
- Ensuring the modules are updated for Ocata changes.

I look forward to working with all of you. I'm open to any suggestions or ideas
for additional places to improve our processes and modules.

Thanks,
Alex Schultz
