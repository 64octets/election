I would like to nominate myself for the Karbor candidacy.
I think I am the best person for the job because I believe no other have the
vision and commitment that I have for the project.
We are still a young project and there is still sadly no one that knows the
architecture and design better than me.
I think the community knows what I'm worth and will make the right decision.
Whatever the result may be I know that we will succeed.
Together we can take Karbor to the next level.
