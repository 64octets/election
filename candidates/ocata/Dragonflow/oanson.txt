I would like to propose my candidacy for Dragonflow PTL position.

My goal for Dragonflow is to make it a reference architecture to implement
networking and distributed networking services in an easy and simple manner
while supporting production grade and large scale requirements.

I think that Dragonflow pluggable architecture is proving to be a strong
choice we made and is even being considered at other OpenStack networking
projects.
I also believe that our simplicity can be very appealing to users that
want a simple network virtualization solution part of OpenStack.

An important goal is to keep Dragonflow an integral part of OpenStack
and make sure to address the various use cases of OpenStack deployments
in terms of networking.

For the next cycle, I would like to see Dragonflow become a viable choice for
cloud deployments. This means a heavy stress on stabilization, deployment, and
performance.

I would also like to see new features make it into the release, such as full
IPv6 support, FWaaS, VPNaaS, and LBaaS.

Thank you,
Omer Anson.
