Hi

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of the OpenStack Charms project.

I'm the incumbent and first PTL of this project, which joined the OpenStack
project in July this year;  Right now we have around 30 charms for deploying
various parts of OpenStack, with an active core team 100% populated by
Canonical.

We're slowly incubating contribution from outside of this team - this cycle
I want to focus on changing that; specifically I think we have shortcomings
in engaging new developers, as getting into OpenStack charm development can
be high cost - the route to testing your charm change prior to submission
currently presents various options, and I want to focus on ensuring that
anyone with a reasonably specified machine can get started deploying
OpenStack and hacking on the OpenStack charms, enabling both end-users and
developers to have a better start in using and understanding the OpenStack
Charms.

I will continue to drive cross charm initiatives; specifically I think
Python 3 support is a key objective during the Ocata cycle, and we should aim
to have that in place as early in cycle as possible.

I also look forward to working collaboratively with other deployment projects
within the OpenStack project.

I look forward to helping steer the project during the Ocata cycle, and
helping to incubate the developer and user community around the OpenStack
Charms!
