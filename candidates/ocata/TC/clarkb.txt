I am standing as a candidate for a seat on the OpenStack Technical
Committee.

I have worked with OpenStack since the Diablo days and have done it
full time since joining the OpenStack Infrastructure team during the
Folsom cycle. During this time I have been an OpenStack developer,
operator, and user.

During the Newton cycle the TC began to work on community wide goals.
I agree with Doug and others that this is a very important step for the
TC and OpenStack to take. We should be able to collaborate on and
solve large scale issues that affect our community.

That said, I recognize that at the end of the day someone has to be
making these changes. I have previously been involved in many community
wide changes including parallelized unittesting, ElasticSearch and
elastic-recheck, multinode testing, and most recently running our tests
with TLS enabled. I know how difficult changes like this can be. Getting
the critical mass of interest needed for reviews to happen and debugging
when things go wrong can be very difficult. If I am elected to the TC my
mission will be to ensure these goals get the visibility required to be
successful, and that we actually work together to achieve these goals as
a community.

As an individual one of the best things about OpenStack for me is that
I get to develop and use Free Software that solves real world problems
for both myself and others. I think the best way for us to continue to
do this is by working together to solve the hard technical problems we
face. Let's make it happen.

Thank you,
Clark
