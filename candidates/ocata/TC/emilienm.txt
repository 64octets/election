This is my candidacy for a position on the OpenStack Technical
Committee.

For those who don't know me, it has been 4 years that I have been
consistently working on OpenStack to make deployments production-ready:

- Puppet OpenStack core contributor, and ex-PTL (18 months).

Writing Puppet modules that allow operators to deploy OpenStack in production.

- TripleO core contributor, and current PTL.

Contribute to TripleO which is an OpenStack installer used by operators to
deploy and operate OpenStack.

- OpenStack Infrastructure contributor.

Improving Continuous Integration for different projects in OpenStack.


Here are some aspects that motivate me to be part of TC:

- Make sure it works outside Devstack.

There is a huge gap between what is tested by Devstack gate and what operators
deploy on the field.  This gap tends to stretch the feedback loop between
developers and operators.  As a community, we might want to reduce this gap
and make OpenStack testing more effective and more realistic.
That's an area of focus I would like to work and spread over OpenStack
projects if I'm elected.


- Keep horizontal collaboration.

While our technical areas of focus might be different, our main goal is to
make OpenStack better and it's important our governance reflects it.
I believe that collaboration works [1] and we have seen positive results over
the last cycles.  I would like TC to keep supporting such efforts and continue to
make OpenStack a great forum to work.


- Share my experience with Technical Committee.

Being PTL during 18 months, I contributed to drive Puppet OpenStack project to
success [2] and I learned so much about communication and technical leadership.
If I'm elected I'll do my best to re-use this experience from my previous roles in
OpenStack.  I've been learning on the go and plan to continue that way by
keeping my mind open to feedback.


- Represent all family members.

Because I've worked on different areas of OpenStack (CI, deployments, testing,
etc), I'll represent the voice of any community member: developers, deployers,
operators and users.  I believe in making decisions by wearing different hats and
find the best solution for everyone.



Over the last years, I've helped into building communities of people who
aim to make OpenStack better.  I would be honored to serve as a TC member.

Thank you for your consideration,
