OpenStack ensures people have a choice.

We give developers choices, which gives deployers choices, which ensures
consumers have choices.

We make choices, evaluate results, revisit and choose again.

OpenStack creates space; personal space, public space. The choice is available.

By virtue of OpenStack's existence people retain belief in themselves. They
retain belief in what they can create with others.

OpenStack is an international experience. Not only is there an opportunity to
listen and understand people with different perspectives and life
experiences, it is a daily occurrence. In no other environment have I spent so
much time considering what the weather is in China, if France is on holiday at
the moment, whether my co-workers are safe. I spend time thinking about the
people I work with more than in any other prior environment. Your lives are all
so very different from my own.

Yet for the most part, I believe we want similar things, to be useful, to help
others and to create something together that is also useful and helps others.

Thank you for reading.
