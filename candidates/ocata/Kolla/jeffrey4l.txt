Hi Everyone,

I'm excited to announce my candidacy for PTL for Kolla team during the Ocata
cycle.  

Kolla is a fantastic project. It brings fresh new blood to OpenStack Deployment
Management. Simplifying the lives of Operators when managing OpenStack is
essential to OpenStack’s success and I personally believe Kolla as of Liberty
1.1.0 delivers on that promise. I also deployed several Kolla production
environment for customers without any problem. I've been a core contributor to
Kolla since Mitaka. I am full time on Kolla project and have been heavily
involved with all of my waking hours[0][1].

Over the Newton development cycle, we have implemented numerous new features
and improved stability and usability. The top features are:

* Introduced the Bifrost and kolla-host to manage the bare metal provision and
  initialize the node before deploying OpenStack.
* The introduction of far more services including Aodh, Bifrost, Ceilometer,
  Cloudkitty, Multipath, Rally, Sahara, Tempest, Watcher.
* Implemented Dockerfile customization.
* Launched the kolla-kubernetes project.
* More robust CI jobs

As a team, the Kolla Community tested 123 nodes for Kolla using osic[2]. The
results validate Kolla works and scales to a majority of use cases today. The
major code paths that enable this scalability have been in place since Liberty
which gives a good indicator of Liberty and Mitaka scalability. As a Kolla
core reviewer and PTL self-nominee, I find this result to be highly satisfying.
One of Kolla’s many goals has been executed: Deploying OpenStack at 100+ node
count fast and easily. 

The kolla community is diversely affiliated, a fantastic crew of contributors,
and excellent leadership within the core reviewer team.

For Ocata, I'd like the project focused on these objectives:

* Focus on the needs of the Kolla team.
* Optimize the speed of reconfiguration and upgrade.
* Implement and integrate with more driver plugins for neutron and cinder.
* Deliver 1.0.0 of kolla-kubernetes.
* Implement different CI jobs to test diverse scenarios.I’d like to start out
  with some really hard CI problems such as testing real upgrades and
  validating ceph in the CI jobs per commit.
* Support the implementation of a monitoring stack.

Finally, I know it is important that PTL time is spent on the non-technical
problem-solving such as mentoring potential core reviewers, scheduling the
project progress, interacting with other OpenStack projects and many other
activities a PTL undertakes.  I’d like to work this cycle on scaling those
activities across the core reviewer team.  I will use my personal strengths and
rely on the core reviewer team’s personal strengths to make Kolla Ocata the
best release yet.

Thank you for the considering me to serve as your Kolla PTL.

Regards,
Jeffrey Zhang
